**1.	# Overview of the analysis:**

## Background
V. Isualize had given me and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we had to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Furthermore, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we had to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Purpose
To create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and to graphically plot the information of the total weekly fares for each city type on a multiple-line graph.

When we look at the table above, Urban cities had 13 times the number of rural drivers! Rural type cities had the lowest number of drivers only 125 whereas Urban cities had 1625. 
This could be since Pyber assumed that people in rural cities use their own vehicles or use public transport such as buses for commuting. Another reason for a higher number of drivers in urban cities could be since they assumed that people will use Pyber rides to commute to work due to parking shortages.

The next table below gives a city-wise breakup based on the type of city. We can use this table to track the number of drivers active on a particular day in a particular city and the fare.

Despite having 13 times higher number of drivers compared to rural areas, the average fares per ride in the urban areas were the lowest at $24 compared to rural areas which clocked in average fares of $34 per ride. 

## Recommendations
1)	Since urban areas have a substantially high number of drivers, the company can introduce promotional schemes/offers to attract new clients. Such as 20% off on the next trip. 
2)	Getting referrals from clients could help in increasing the number of rides. Pyber could also target women clients with the introduction of women drivers. 
3)	Rural areas have fewer drivers, yet they have a higher average fare per driver. Probably since the people avail of taxi services to travel inter-town. This strategy seems to be working well and Pyber should continue with this. Infact, they can probably expand their team in these areas. Having a larger team could help penetrate the market deeper and they could lure people to taking Pyber rides for shorter trips as well. 
4)	Suburban cities are performing well, with an average ride amount of $30 per ride. This strategy seems to be working well and it could be replicated in the urban areas too. 
5)	Finally, despite the promotional offers if Pyber is unable to improve the efficiency of the urban areas, they may need to rethink the people strategy. They could begin by implementing hiring freezes momentarily.
